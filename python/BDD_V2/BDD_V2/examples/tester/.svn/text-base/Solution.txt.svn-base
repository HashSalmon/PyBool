This example solves the first Lewis Carroll puzzle as found on
pg 125 of the book:

Computation Engineering - applied automata theory and logic
by Dr. Ganesh Gopalakrishnan

This can be solved writing an appropriate boolean formula and 
using a BDD. First lets consider the formula:

The premises are:
1. Babies are illogical;
2. Nobody is despised who can manage a crocodile;
3. Illogical persons are despised.

and from these, we are to conclude that:
Babies cannot manage crocodiles

The premises can be encoded as the following boolean expressions:
1. babies => illogical
2. manageCrocs => ~despised
3. illogical => despised

Our Conclusion can be coded as:

babies => ~manageCrocs

Now to make sure all the premises are enforced, we 
conjoin them all together to get:

(babies => illogical) & (manageCrocs => ~despised) & (illogical => despised)

From here, we can conjoin in the negation of our conclusion. Using this
approach we can then use the BDD to look for 0 satisfying assignments.

The final Boolean expression can be found in BabiesAndCrocs.txt
and the simple BDD script can be found in runMe.py
